# Etch-A-Sketch

This in-browser Etch-A-Sketch project was created as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations). This project was especially helpful for me gaining practice in:
 - **DOM Element Creation:** Used JavaScript to create each grid tile and insert it into the game container
 - **Manipulating Styles with DOM Events:** added event listener to 'activate' hovered over grids by adding a CSS class
 - **CSS GRID:** Utilized to organize the grid tiles within the Etch-A-Sketch
